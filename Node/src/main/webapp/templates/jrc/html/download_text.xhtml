    <p>With the download link provided in this page, you can download all datasets and related files as one big zip file.</p>

    <p style="color:red">Note, that the zip file is very large and will take some time to download

        because it contains beside the processes all related flow data sets, documentation files, XML schemas and stylesheets

        for offline display and exploration of the format.</p>

    <p>Usage notes</p>

    <ul>

        <li>Please unpack the zip file in a directory on your computer not too deep under

            the root directory, because otherwise Windows will cut file names due to the

            maximum allowable path length and the data sets will not be displayed

            correctly.</li>

        <li>To view a process file locally on your computer, just open one of the XML

            files in the subdirectory "processes" in your favourite web browser.

            Follow the blue links to see the, flows, documentation etc.</li>

        <li style="color:red">Please do not rename, change or delete any of the files in the download package,

            as they may not be displayed correctly anymore (especially MS Internet Explorer is sensitive).

            Note, that the system is designed to be processed and managed in database systems of LCA software

            and that the manual management in the file system on your harddisk has limitations.</li>

    </ul>
