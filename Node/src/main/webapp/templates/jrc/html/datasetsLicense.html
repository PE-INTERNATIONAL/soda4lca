**********
Preceding, non-legally binding explanations:
These license conditions guarantee to everybody a free access to and use of 
the ELCD II core data sets in LCA studies, for deriving own data sets, etc. 
They help to avoid misue such as selling these cost free data sets or 
misusing the name of the Commission, of the data owner or "ELCD" in inappropriate 
advertisements. They hence guarantee to you as data set user that you are properly 
informed what you get under the name "ELCD", at the same time protecting the 
related interests of the European Commission and of the data set owners. 
The license conditions also ask that proper reference is made when an 
ELCD II core data set is used. Follows below the legally binding license text.
**********

SCOPE
This license refers to the data sets published in the ELCD core 
database version 2 ("ELCD II core data sets"), found online at 
http://lca.jrc.ec.europa.eu. The database is published by the European 
Commission, Directorate-General Joint Research Centre, Institute for 
Environment and Sustainability (JRC-IES), European Platform on Life Cycle 
Assessment (EPLCA).


DEFINITIONS
- "Modified"/"Modifications" refers to have ommitted, changed or added 
   information of a data set, resulting in a data set that still represents 
   the same or an insignificantly differing product system as the original 
   data set. This does not refer to changed storage form or format of a data set.
- "Derived" refers to a data set that was obtained by integrating via 
   mathematical operations one or more of the ELCD II core data sets AND 
   by making use of substantial additional information and/or third party 
   data sets, resulting in a significantly differing data set for a 
   significantly different product system.


REDISTRIBUTION, USE, MODIFICATION, DERIVATION
Redistribution, use, modification, and derivation of any one of the ELCD 
II core data sets, independently whether in ILCD format or any other form or 
format, is permitted to everybody and free of charge, provided all the 
following conditions are met as referring to the respective activity. Moreover, 
these conditions also apply analogously to those ELCD II core database-based data 
sets that were already previously redistributed, used, modified or derived:

* Redistribution of an unmodified or modified ELCD core data set must 
  retain the original information about the owner of that data set (field 
  referenceToOwnershipOfDataSet), and this license text. This can be done inside 
  the data set or in additional documentation and/or other materials provided 
  with the redistribution. If this is done not inside the data set, a clearly 
  visible reference named "copyright notice and license conditions" must be put 
  inside the data set and point to where the copyright notice and this license 
  text can be found and freely and easily accessed, e.g. 
  at http://lca.jrc.ec.europa.eu. 

* Distribution of data sets for price, license fee or similar is only permittable for derived
  data sets. The modified or unmodified ELCD II core data sets, in whatever form or 
  format, may only be redistributed free of any related charge, license fee or similar.

* Redistribution of modified ELCD II core data sets in whatever form or format 
  has to be avoided as far as possible. In any case the distributor of 
  a ELCD II core data set has to clearly document inside the data set and in a 
  prominent place which modifications have been made.

* Upon any modifications of a data set and equally for derived data sets, the 
  consistency and conformity declarations (section consistencyAndConformity), 
  if present, have to be checked and adjusted accordingly.

* Upon any modifications of a data set and equally for derived data sets, and 
  especially in the Inputs and Outputs sections of the data set but possibly 
  also in other sections, the review information (section review), if present, 
  has to be checked and adjusted accordingly or removed.

* Upon any modifications of a data set and equally for derived data sets, the 
  approval of the dataset (field dataSetUseApproval), if present and the ownership 
  (field referenceToOwnershipOfDataSet), if present, are void and have to be 
  removed entirely. 

* Upon any modifications of a data set and equally for derived data sets, neither 
  the name "ELCD" nor that of the original data set owner nor the publisher of 
  the ELCD II core database nor any derivations of those names or otherwise confusingly 
  similar expressions may be used to promote such data sets without specific prior 
  written permission from the EPLCA(1)(2) and/or from the owner of the original data set, 
  whichever organisation should be referred to in the promotion for the modified 
  or derived data set.

* If a data set is distributed in a modified or another format than the ILCD format, 
  the distributing party must prevent that the receiver of such a data set can get 
  the impression that the data set is provided in the ILCD format. Among others 
  does this mean that the present information about the data set's format (field 
  referenceToDataSetFormat) is to be removed from the data set.

* The correct citation for external communications and advertisements of unmodified 
  ELCD II core data redistributions is as a minimum "ELCD II core data sets - 
  http://lca.jrc.ec.europa.eu" plus the data sets' version number(s). 
  For modified data sets the citation has to be "ELCD II core data sets, modified 
  - http://lca.jrc.ec.europa.eu" plus the data sets' version number(s).

* Use of data sets in commercial or noncommercial studies or to develop derived 
  data sets is permissible if proper reference is given to their use as "ELCD II core 
  data sets, http://lca.jrc.ec.europa.eu. (c) European Commission 1995-2009". 
  However, the above referred to user of the ELCD II core data sets must strictly avoid 
  to give the impression, that his or her study or results or recommendations of 
  the study, or derived data sets might be endorsed by the European Commission or its 
  bodies or by the owner(s) of any of the used ELCD II core data sets.

* Extracts exclusively of the section dataSetInformation of a data set may be used 
  in other contexts such as e.g. publications or presentations if proper reference 
  is given to its source as "Documentation extract of the data set <data set name> 
  owned by <owner name>. Published in the ELCD II core data base, 
  http://lca.jrc.ec.europa.eu. (c) European Commission 1995-2009".
 
* As soon as a new version of any of the ELCD II core data sets is made available by the 
  European Commission for public and cost free access, the license rights 
  granted in this license to redistribute modified or unmodified data sets of the former 
  version expires within 6 months after first publication of the new version 
  of that data set and the old data sets shall not be redistributed anymore. Also shall the 
  user of such old versions of the data sets not communicate anymore to be using ELCD II 
  core data sets. Previously derived data sets are not affected by these conditions. 
  For continued use of the old data sets in an ongoing LCA project the above named 
  6 months prolongs to 12 months. The responsibility to identify the fact of availability of a 
  new data set version lies with the data set user.


THE ELCD CORE DATA SETS ARE PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS 
"AS ARE" AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE

CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, 
OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE, 
DISTRIBUTION OR MODIFICATION OF ANY OF THESE DATA SETS, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE 
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

Furthermore the "Important legal notice" of the European Commission as presently 
found at http://www.europa.eu/geninfo/legal_notices_en.htm fully applies. 
In case of contradictions with this license text or unclarities that "Important 
legal notice" is binding, rendering invalid any possibly deviating conditions set 
forth in this license, while the not affected conditions still apply.


--------------------------
(1) The use of the expressions "ILCD formatted" and "ILCD Data Network compliant documentation" 
    is herewith automatically granted for a derived data set, if it is fully 
    "ILCD valid" and "ILCD compliant" as defined in the "ILCD Data Network compliance rules"
    (distributed with the ELCD II core database). This includes, that such 
    a data set shall be editable with the ILCD Data Set Editor, which will be made available 
    via http://lca.jrc.ec.europa.eu. See also the license conditions for the ILCD format, 
    also accessible via the same website.
(2) If a derived data set is provided in another format than the ILCD format, but the 
    documentation meets the documentation requirements regarding scope and permitted 
    entries, the expression "ILCD compliant documentation" may be used but always 
    in conjunction with the information in which format the data set and/or its 
    documentation is provided. It has to be made sufficiently clear by the data set 
    distributor to the recepient of such information/advertisement that the data set 
    is not provided in the ILCD format.
