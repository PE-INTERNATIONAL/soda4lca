1.2.0  January 16, 2012 (build 167)

NOTICE: For handling changes to the database schema, the Flyway framework has been introduced. This will make it
		unneccessary to perform manual database upgrades in the future. The downside is, that this release will NOT
		work with 1.1.x databases and requires an empty database schema. That means you may have to backup your data 
		prior to using this release (using the export feature introduced in release 1.1.3), emtpy the database and
		re-import the data afterwards.

- issue 166: elementary flow detection bug

- issue 167: add feature to export entire database, using context path as filename
